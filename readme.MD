# DDD in Go
This repository is used to present how I find based on my experience how DDD works in Go projects

The DDD Patterns and components are discussed in  [How To Implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) inÂ Golang](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-implement-domain-driven-design-ddd-in-golang-2e2139beb09d)  

This branch refactores the old solution and builds a more clean architectural solution that I use in many projects successfully.  

This repository is contains a better project layout to apply DDD.

The reasons behind the structure is discussed in [How to Structure DDD in Golang](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-structure-ddd-in-golang-28a7c3e7263b)
